                <p>I'm originally from a small town 30 minutes east of Birmingham, AL named Pell City. After high school graduation, I attended Shelton State Community College. After my freshmen year, I transferred to The University of Alabama where I marched snare drum in the Million Dollar Band. I currently work for the drum company who provided our percussion instruments at The University of Alabama, Pearl Corporation. I still enjoy playing the drums today.</p>

                    <p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex is my favorite dinosaur. 'The “king of the tyrant lizards” will always be one of the scariest and deadliest dinosaurs around with a bite force three times that of a great white shark - making it the strongest bite force of any land animal that has ever lived.' Tyrannosaurus is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often colloquially called simply T. rex or T-Rex, is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hindlimbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 m in length, up to 3.66 meters tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates 8.4 metric tons to 14 metric tons in weight.</p>
