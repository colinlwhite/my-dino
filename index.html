                <p>I'm originally from a small town 30 minutes east of Birmingham, AL named Pell City. After high school graduation, I attended Shelton State Community College. After my freshmen year, I transferred to The University of Alabama where I marched snare drum in the Million Dollar Band. I currently work for the drum company who provided our percussion instruments at The University of Alabama, Pearl Corporation. I still enjoy playing the drums today.</p>
